## Code of Conduct

### 1. copy & pastable
All the codes in this site are ready-to-be-compiled that means you could just copy & paste it to see it works.
### 2. Compatibility
Data Structure implementations should be compatible with C++ STL.  
ex) sort(Your_implementation.begin(), Your_implementation.end()) should work.

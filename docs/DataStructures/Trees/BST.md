#Binary Search Tree
A Search tree is called Binary Search if it satisfies `BST property` and it's #children $\leq$ 2.

## Binary Search Tree Property
Let $x$ be a node in a binary search tree. If $y$ is a node in the left subtree of $x$, then $y.key \leq x.key$. If $y$ is a node in the right subtree of $x$, then $y.key \leq x.key$.

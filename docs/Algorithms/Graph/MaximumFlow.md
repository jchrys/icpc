# Maximum Flow
> Finding a maximum flow: What is the maximum amount of flow we can send from a node to another node?

> The input for problem is directed, weighted graph that contains two special nodes: the $\text{source}$ is a node with no incoming edges, and the $\text{sink}$ is a node with no outgoing edges.

> in the maximum flow problem, our task is to send as much flow as possible from the source to the sink.

> The weight of each edge is a capacity that restricts the flow that can go through the edge.
> In each intermediate node, the incoming and outgoing flow has to be equal.

# Minimum cut
> In the minimum cut problem, our task is to remove a set of edges from the graph such that there will be no path from the source to the sink after the removal and the total weight of the removed edges is minimum.

> It turns out that a maximum flow and a minimum cut are always equally large, so the concepts are two sides of the same coin.
